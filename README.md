# ATM Machine

## Overview

The ATM Machine is a simple console-based application written in Java. It simulates the functionality of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM), allowing users to perform operations such as withdrawing, depositing, and checking their balance.

## Features

1. **User Interface:**
   - Design a user interface for the ATM, including options for withdrawing, depositing, and checking the balance.

2. **Operation Methods:**
   - Implement methods for each option, such as `withdraw(amount)`, `deposit(amount)`, and `checkBalance()`.

3. **User Account:**
   - Create a class to represent the user's bank account, which stores the account balance.

4. **Connection with ATM:**
   - Connect the ATM class with the user's bank account class to access and modify the account balance.

5. **Input Validation:**
   - Validate user input to ensure it is within acceptable limits (e.g., sufficient balance for withdrawals).

6. **User Messages:**
   - Display appropriate messages to the user based on their chosen options and the success or failure of their transactions.
